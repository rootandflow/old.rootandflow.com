5. You Don't Know Your Place  
You are a value-brand, Spotify. Yes, even you're premium tier of service. And there's nothing wrong with that. Except that you don't seem to know it. I know it. Even 

4. You Blackmail  

3. You Beg  
Worse, you make talented musicians -- skilled artists! -- beg too.  
Shame on you, Spotify. 

2. Video? WTF!?!  
You are a music app. MUSIC. Nobody wants to watch video with you. Do the thing you told us is the thing your do.  

1. You Kill the Mood.  
Kill it? Spotify your tone-deaf commercials straight up MURDER the vibe. When I'm listening to Hans Zimmer, I don't want to hear . On the flip side, when I am jamming out to Katie Perry (as is my white male priviledge), I'm not in the mood for a sudden sample of bumfunk grindcore, or whatever JARRING AS ALL HELL canker-sore of a song excerpt you interpose in my shuffle set. 
You know half of what you're selling is mood, right? Why do I use you? Because I trust you.  
Stop running around town, Spotify. Be faithful to me and I'll be faithful to you.
