5. You Don't Know Your Place  
You are a value-brand, Spotify. Yes, even you're premium tier of service. And there's nothing wrong with that. Except that you don't seem to know it. I know it. Even 

4. You Blackmail  

3. You Beg  
Worse, you make talented musicians -- skilled artists! -- beg too.  
Shame on you, Spotify. 

2. Video? WTF!?!  
You are a music app. MUSIC. Nobody wants to watch video with you. Do the thing you told us is the thing your do.  

1. You Kill the Mood.  
Kill it? Spotify your tone-deaf commercials straight up MURDER the vibe. When I'm listening to Hans Zimmer, I don't want to hear a peppermint poptart Brit's gushing over Calvin Harris. I don't care if his new track featuring Bastille is perfect for my party mix -- I'm not listening to my party mix. I WAS listening to Sheila E and company drumming like mad on the Man of Steel Soundtrack, but you had to go and derail that train, didn't you Spotify.  
Presumably, Calvin Harris's people PAID you a lot of money to get the word out about his new Bastille collab track. And what have you accomplished here? I HATE that track. Because you had the nerve to play it way too loud at 2 in the morning when I was listening to the most beautiful strings melody in all of Batman ever.  
WTF?  
You're doing a diservice to me, the listener, and to any artist who pays you to promote their material.  
There's nothing wrong with promotion. But there is a lot wrong with how you do it Spotify.  
You know half of what you're selling is mood, right? Why do I use you? Because I trust you.  
Stop running around town, Spotify. Be faithful to me and I'll be faithful to you.
