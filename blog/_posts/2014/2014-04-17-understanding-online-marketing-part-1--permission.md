This is the first part in a two part series on Online Marketing. 
Part 2: {% post_url 2014-04-21-understanding-online-marketing-part-2--data.md %}

Online marketing has two fundamental advantages over traditional advertising: Data and Permission. While neither are completely exclusive to the online space, in this two-part series we will see how the nature of the Internet as a two-communication medium makes both individually more powerful. Taken together, they act as a complete game-changer. 

Permission
Offline Advertising Forces Attention with Money.  
Do you ever:
	•	Visit a billboard? 
	•	Search for a radio jingle? 
	•	Ask to be Direct Mailed?
	•	Subscribe to network commercial breaks? 
Of course you don’t! Outdoor advertising is always an interruption. Advertisers squeeze their way into people’s attention. Companies foot the bill for what they hope people want with the aim of guilt-trip those same people into paying attention to something the don’t. They’re making demands, not offers. At best the result is indifference; at worst they’re paying money to breed resentment. 
People fight back. 
Do you ever: 
	•	Ignore billboards? 
	•	Flip through radio stations? 
	•	Trash junk mail?
	•	TiVo (link to article on name branding, getting there first i.e. Google, Kleenex) past TV commercials? 
Interruption-based marketing positions the advertiser as a visitor, and people as the host. Because they are imposing themselves on their hosts, interruption-based advertisers are seen as intrusive and unwelcome guests. Who wants that in their home? Nobody. 
Online Marketer Earns Attention with Quality. 
The advantage of marketing online is that the Internet is an interactive based medium. The Internet replaces the saturated broadcast of one-direction, interruption-based traditional media with a two-way dynamic of interaction. The true power of online marketing is it’s potential to be interaction-based rather then an inherent interruption.
 This flips the dynamic. The online marketer is now the host, the owner of the domain, and people are our visitors. They come to us! We see this reflected in the language of the web: Web visitors are the people, not the marketer, and our web content is served, rather then imposed. 
Of course not all advertising on the Internet realizes the potential of online marketing. Just like the early days of television, when commercials were essentially televised radio spots — some of them even came complete with the broadcast microphone! —  the old-school broadcast mentality is still prevalent in plenty of today’s online marketing efforts. (Link to you’re doing it wrong article about Hulu. Which ad do you prefer? None of the above!)

Effective marketers understand the difference between interruption and interaction-based advertising, and its the individuals and businesses that utilize these marketers who will reap the rewards of greater market-share and rising revenues.
