This is the second part in a two part series on Online Marketing.  
Part 1: {% post_url 2014-04-17-understanding-online-marketing-part-1--permission.md %}  

In part one we looked at the fundamental advantage interaction-based marketing gives online marketers over the interruption-based marketing found in nearly all traditional advertising.  

However, while gaining permission through interactivity is much easier online, it isn’t exclusive to the Internet. Wunderman’s Gold Box (link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidvinjamuri/2012/04/25/why-the-brand-america-campaign-misses-the-mark-it-fails-the-gold-box-test/) and American Idol’s voting-by-text dynamic are examples of interactivity in traditional media.  

It’s the pairing of Permission with Data — the second advantage of online marketing over traditional media — that allows savvy online marketers to achieve a level of branding engagement impossible before. And greater brand engagement fuels the achievement of business goals.  

### Data  

We established that Permission results from the role swap that occurs on the web: the marketer is now the host and the person interacting with web content is the visitor. Instead of interrupting people — and irritating them — while they wait to do what they want to do, now people seek our content out. Now, interacting with what we offer IS what visitors want to do.  

Accurate measurements hits in the offline world is impossible, but online we know exactly how many times we get a click. In fact, we know how long it took for someone to decide to click and what the DIDN’T click instead...
