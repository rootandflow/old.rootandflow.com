One of my Improv students brought a sales catalog for Girl Scout cookies to share with the class. Even though the boxes of goodies were weeks away for anyone placing an order, the minutes before my workshop were consumed by a mini-frenzy of tagalongs and thin-mints. Everyone shared a laugh decoding which names meant which kinds of cookies. And people signed up.  

Witnessing a bit of domestic salesmanship before my acting workshop highlights how constantly we are submitted to an ”ask.” People constantly come to us for a “Yes.” We experience one request or another All The Time. It can be person-to-person, like my student Girl Scout Mom and her classmates. But the majority of it comes through media.  

Every day we are smothered under a blanket of marketing. It seeks us out, intent on selling us something. What its done instead is train us to reflexively say “No.” Even children learn to use “No” as a first response. Children who want anything that stimulates them — and because they are new people, that’s everything. Yet from a young age kids experience school fundraisers, team car washes, scholastic book clubs, church bake sales, charity runs and yes, Girl Scout cookie sales drives. And they grow up into adults with a well built Wall of No.  

This is the environment we operate in as businesses. Our sales prospects have been steeped in this culture of Buy!/Deny! The critical mistake companies make is disregarding this wall and going straight for the sale. You hit the wall of no. If we’re going to create consistent sales revenue, we need a better method to find our way to yes.
